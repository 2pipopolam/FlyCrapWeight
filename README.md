I have no idea how to run it on Windows, but if you can, just place an agent named Cube Spawner on level and play with the values of the Spawn field in the Details of Cube Spawner. 

Compare the time it takes to spawn all the cubes using the Normal Spawn method to the time it takes to spawn using the Flyweight Spawn method. 

The time is displayed in the console.
